Question 1: Cloud Access Control
How would you control access to a cloud network?
1. Restate the Problem
   * When you implement systems and application access controls in order to only let authorized users access cloud data and applications
      * It only lets certain users from accessing private information.This helps companies and users avoid DDos attacks

   2. Provide a Concrete Example Scenario

      * In Project 1, did you deploy an on-premises or cloud network?
      * Cloud network it was easier to access my VMs and Load Balancers a lot easier.
      * Did you have to configure access controls to this network?
      * Yes and I had to white list my IP address a few times,but overall I was able to  access the controls so that other users could access it through my credentials
      * What kinds of access controls did you configure, and why were they necessary?
      * I was able to make my VMs private so the only way they could access the file is through the ssh key I provided and the user.That way I can tell the employer that people with knowledge of the IP address and the user could access the info on git bash.
      * How do these details relate to the interview question?
      * It is helpful so that the employer gets the gist of what I did on the cloud network.It gives a person who lacks in  knowledge a better understanding.
Question 4: Cloud Infrastructure as Code
What are the security benefits of defining cloud infrastructure as code?
      1. Restate the Problem
It easier to access your VMs and distribute yaml files
      2. Provide a Concrete Example Scenario

         * In Project 1, when did you use infrastructure as code (IaC)?
         1. Setting up my elk server and preparing my yaml code so it code deploy  filebeat and metricbeat
         * What tool did you use?
         1. docker 
         * What did you use it to do?
         1. It allowed me to set up a up a elk server and made it easier to set up some of yaml codes for filebeat/metricbeat
         3. Explain the Solution Requirements

            * Were there any alternatives to IaC?
            1. Docker is a great alternative to a IaC,I like it a lot better and find it easier to  package and deploy them in any environment.
            * What benefits does IaC have over alternative approaches?
            1. The speed is a lot faster and more consistent on deploying and packaging an environment
            4. Explain the Solution Details

               * In Project 1, which specific configurations did your IaC set up?
               1. To check if ELK server was running
               * How did you run and test these configurations?
               1. - sudo docker container list -a 
               2. - sudo docker start container 
               3. - sudo docker attach container
               5. Identify Advantages/Disadvantages of the Solution

                  * Are there any disadvantages to using IaC over the "traditional" approach?
                  1. The approach to distribute the code in the release pipeline is efficient for a few time use,but as the environment changes so does the Iac
